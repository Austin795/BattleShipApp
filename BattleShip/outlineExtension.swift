/*
 * This code snippet is from a tutorial I found online.  Link above to tutorial and source code.
 * I'm choosing to use this code because I wanted to have an outline on some text on the project
 * UIViewcontrollers so it was readable aganist a blue background.  I searched awhile in menus and online to see if there was an easier way but no luck.
 * This is the only method of making an outline on text in swift I found so I used it.
 * If there is a menu option or easier way to do it just comment it in here.
 * You can use it just by saying labelName.makeOutLine
 *
